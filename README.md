Amount of budget you were given vs the output 

imagine science was that easy and amount of people that would be killed by American High school Mathematics and sceicne. I am just saying.

Too busy partying, drinking, shoot other(real and Fortine. my high school time was Call of duty. And they on mobile. Mabye PugG) Th4ey be watching streamings on different devices in class room too who knows, and doing 18+ plus stuff.

Finger cross for UFO in area 51

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The comparison between the budget allocated and the output achieved raises an intriguing thought: what if science were truly that straightforward? Consider the impact of simplifying American high school mathematics and scienceâ€”how many lives could be affected? Just a thought. Meanwhile, it seems many are preoccupied with partying, drinking, violence, and adult activities. Here's hoping for UFO sightings in Area 51.
